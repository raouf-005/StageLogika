# Child Management with React

Welcome to the Child Management project developed with React. This application allows you to manage information about children enrolled in a childcare center using React, props, context, and hooks. The code is thoroughly commented to explain the approach.

## Features

### Part 1: Adding a Child

- I have created a `ChildForm` that enables you to add a new child to the childcare center. The form includes fields for the child's name, surname, ID, place of birth, date of birth, a photo of the child, and a dropdown menu to select the parent.

### Part 2: Displaying Children

- I have implemented a `ChildTable` component that displays a table of existing children. Child data is passed as props and is presented in a readable format.

### Part 3: Context for Managing Data

- I have integrated React Context to manage the global state of the application. This allows for efficient handling of data and actions for adding and modifying children.

### Bonus
-I removed the EditChildForm and used the orginal form to update so no popup and better ui experience for the user
-I tried every possible combination off buttons to try and create a bug but i made the neccesarry function to prevent it from happening
-Csss styling i did a basic css styling to reduce the time of the building the website (3 days of working to finsih it)
