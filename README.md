# Child Management with React

Welcome to the Child Management project developed with React. This application allows you to manage information about children enrolled in a childcare center using React, props, context, and hooks. The code is thoroughly commented to explain the approach.

## Features

### Part 1: Adding a Child

- I have created a `ChildForm` that enables you to add a new child to the childcare center. The form includes fields for the child's name, Surname, ID, place of birth, date of birth, a photo of the child, and a dropdown menu to select the parent.

### Part 2: Displaying Children

- I have implemented a `ChildTable` component that displays a table of existing children. Child data is passed as props and is presented in a readable format.

### Part 3: Context for Managing Data

- I have integrated React Context to manage the global state of the application. This allows for efficient handling of data and actions for adding and modifying children.

### Bonus
- I removed the EditChildForm and used the original form to update, so no popup and a better UI experience for the user.
- I tried every possible combination of buttons to try and create a bug, but I made the necessary functions to prevent it from happening.
- CSS styling: I did basic CSS styling to reduce the time of building the website (3 days of working to finish it).
